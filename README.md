//Tactics//

This ship is designed to be a small, hard to spot scout ship with enough range to be used offensively and defensively.
Offensively this ship can be used to follow targets of importance, either to lead other combat ships to the target, or to make a boarding action at the right moment.
You have unimpeded FOV to fire handheld weapons from the pilot seat, making this a perfect disposible to travel to infantry fights.
Defensively this ship allows scouting of dangerous situations, and can be used to travel to key locations without being followed yourself.
Did i mention this ship is cheaper than dirt, new player friendly, almost all T1, making it great for emergency ship recovery (just ditch it, it costs nothing).
